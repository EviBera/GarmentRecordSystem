# GarmentRecordSystem

This is a C# coding task that involves working with JSON data, saving it to a file, and loading it back. It is able to perform basic CRUD operations. 

The solution has three projects:
* a Class Library project for modelling and implementing the basic services,
* a Console project for a simple console UI,
* and a WPF project for a 'Windows UI'.

I have used .NET 7.0 to solve the task.
